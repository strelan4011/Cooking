*From Saveurs magazine #278, Oct-Nov 2021 issue, pg. 31*

Preparation: 10 minutes
Cooking: 45 minutes
For 6-8 people

## Ingredients

- 350g pitted prunes
- 125g plain flour
- 120g brown sugar + 2 tablespoons to finish
- 40g salted butter + more for the dish
- 4 eggs
- 300ml buttermilk
- 200ml whole milk
- 2 tablespoons dark rum
- 1 sachet vanilla sugar
- salt

Utensil: 1 28 x 20cm oven dish

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, mix the flour with 2 pinches of salt, the brown sugar and the vanilla sugar. Beat the eggs and rum, then mix in the buttermilk and whole milk.
2. Preheat the oven to 180C. Spread the prunes in a 28x20cm greased oven dish. Gently pour in the batter, place small knobs of butter on top and sprinkle brown sugar.
3. Bake for 45 minutes. If the top is browning too quickly, reduce the temperature a bit.
4. Leave to cool before serving in slices.

Accompanying drink: an aged rum.

## Notes

- Vanilla sugar very difficult to find. Can be substituted with extract (about 1 teaspoon)
- A good quality rum really helps, but brandy or similar spirits can be used. Can also be omitted entirely as per traditional recipe.
- Other dried fruits can be used. Dried apricots or cherries probably best choices. As with the rum, these can also be omitted.
- Keep in the fridge, but best served at room temperature or only slightly chilled.
